This repository contains various remote sensing, Google Earth Engine, ArcPy, and Python-based tools for different geospatial applications. The overall purpose of these tools is to provide a set of functions that can be used to automate common geospatial tasks.

## List of Tools

1. Image Dates Acquisition Tool for Visualizing Image Availability for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 
(
  [GEE App](https://waleedgis.users.earthengine.app/view/imagedates) 
| 
  [Advanced Python Version Notebook](https://github.com/waleedgeo/geotools/blob/main/tools/01_image_dates/image_dates.ipynb)
)

**More tools coming soon!**

## Installation

Currently, the geotools require Python 3 and associated libraries like numpy, rasterio, ee, geemap etc. Specific dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. The easiest way to install the dependencies is to use conda. If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). After installing conda, [check this repository](https://github.com/opengeos/python-geospatial) to install required dependencies.

Clone the repository and install requirements:

```git
git clone https://github.com/waleedgeo/geotools.
```

Then you can open each jupyter noteebook in the scripts directory and run the code
